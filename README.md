## Neural-Language-Translation

## Implemented LSTM and attention model.

####  Used Keras, Tensorflow libraries (Python) for my implementation.
####  Used encoder-decoder model in sequence to sequence modeling.

## Details:

####  Building a sequence to sequence neural machine translation (NMT) model .
####  Implemented LSTM with attention for Language translation from Urdu to English.
####  Data set can be downloaded from http://www.manythings.org/anki/deu-eng.zip/urd-eng.zip
